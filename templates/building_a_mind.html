    <p>The Building A Mind lab runs cutting-edge research on the nature vs nurture debate using computer vision, and
        it is opening up its research by making the project open-source. The software involved is complex, however,
        and limited documentation is available. To ensure the research is accessible to as many people as possible,
        I joined a team of other researchers to create a beginner-friendly interface and educational resource for
        the models.</p>
