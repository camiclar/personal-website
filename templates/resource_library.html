    <p>IU's office of Career Exploration &amp; Student Employment hosts an online library of nearly 400 career
        resources which is regularly updated to add new resources and remove old ones. All of these resources were
        stored in a JSON file, however, making them difficult to edit, especially for those without technical
        backgrounds. This prompted a data migration project moving these resources to Airtable and updating the
        client-facing UI, creating a streamlined experience for both staff and students.</p>

    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>The original resource library was difficult to maintain and update. All resources were stored in a JSON file, making it challenging for non-technical staff to add, edit, or remove resources. This created bottlenecks and limited the library's ability to stay current with new career resources.</p>

    <h2>Filtering Challenges</h2>
    <p>The original system had limited filtering capabilities, making it difficult for students to find relevant resources. The interface lacked intuitive ways to narrow down the nearly 400 resources by category, type, or other criteria.</p>

    <h2>The Solution</h2>
    <p>We migrated the data to Airtable, which provided a user-friendly interface for staff to manage resources, and redesigned the front-end to include improved filtering and search capabilities. The new system streamlined both the management and user experience.</p>
